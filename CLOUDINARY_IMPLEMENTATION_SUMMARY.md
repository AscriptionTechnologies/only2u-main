```

## 🔒 Security

### What's Secure
✅ API Secret never exposed to browser  
✅ Uploads go through server API route  
✅ File validation on both client and server  
✅ `.env.local` in `.gitignore`  

### Best Practices
✅ Never commit `.env.local` to git  
✅ Use different credentials for production  
✅ Rotate API credentials regularly  
✅ Monitor Cloudinary usage dashboard
