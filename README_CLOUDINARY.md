# 🎉 Cloudinary Upload Implementation - Complete!

## ✅ What's Done

Your admin dashboard now uses **Cloudinary** for automatic image and video uploads instead of manual URL pasting!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Get Cloudinary Credentials (2 min)

1. Sign up at: **[cloudinary.com/users/register/free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)**
2. Copy your credentials from the dashboard:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in project root:

```env
# Cloudinary (NEW - Add these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here

# Supabase (EXISTING - Keep these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ljnheixbsweamlbntwvh.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

See `ENV_SETUP_TEMPLATE.txt` for a copy/paste template.

### 3. Restart Server & Test

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Go to **Add Product** page
2. Click **"+"** under Product Media
3. Select image/video files
4. Watch them upload automatically! ✨

## 🔒 Security

### What's Secure
✅ API Secret stays on server (never exposed)  
✅ Uploads go through API route  
✅ File validation (client + server)  
✅ `.env.local` in `.gitignore`  

### Best Practices
- ✓ Never commit `.env.local`
- ✓ Use different credentials for production
- ✓ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✓ Monitor Cloudinary usage
