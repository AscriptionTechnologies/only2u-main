```typescript
// Media library with size assignments
type MediaWithSizes = {
  url: string;
  assignedSizes: string[]; // Array of size IDs
};

// State
mediaLibrary: {
  images: MediaWithSizes[];
  videos: MediaWithSizes[];
}
```

      assignedSizes: ["size-id-small", "size-id-medium"]
    },
    {
      url: "https://cloudinary.com/image2.jpg",
      assignedSizes: ["size-id-large", "size-id-xlarge"]
    }
  ],
