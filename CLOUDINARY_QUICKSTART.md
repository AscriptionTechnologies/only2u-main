## Example `.env.local` File

Here's what your complete `.env.local` should look like:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration (NEW - Required for uploads)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dxy123456
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=987654321098765
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt123456

# Supabase Configuration (EXISTING - Keep these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ljnheixbsweamlbntwvh.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Upload not working?

**Check 1:** Did you restart the dev server after adding environment variables?
```bash
# Stop server and restart
npm run dev
```

**Check 2:** Are your credentials correct?
- Log in to Cloudinary dashboard
- Copy credentials again (they might be different)
- Update `.env.local`
- Restart server

**Check 3:** Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
